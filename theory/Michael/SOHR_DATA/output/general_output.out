General output:
    
  Number of Elements (NMM) =            6
  Number of Species (NKK) =          110
  Number of Reactions (NII) =          631
 
  Please make sure that in the file 'global_extern_vars.h', the value of the constant 'NumberOfReactions' 
  is  the same as 'Number of Reactions (NII)', and the value of the constant 'NumberOfSpecies' is the     
  same as 'Number of Species (NKK)'.

  LENRCK =         9347
  LENCCK =          116
    
  Please make sure that the values of constants 'LENIWK', 'LENRWK' and 'LENCWK' in the file               
  'global_extern_vars.h' are the same as those in the file 'ckvariables.f'. Also, they must               
  be larger than  'LENICK', 'LENRCK' and 'LENCCK' respectively.
